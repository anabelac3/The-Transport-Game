We will now randomly assign each of you to the three transport companies. So we will now determine whether you represent Company A (the large company that transports 4 tons), Company B (the medium-sized company that transports 3 tons) or Company C (the smallest company that transports 2 tons). Throughout the experiment, you will continue to represent the same company.
