        We now explain how you will later negotiate with the other two participants in this study. You will negotiate according to a set pattern of bids and responses. We call this a round of negotiation.
        </p>
        <p>
        A negotiation round consists of 3 phases:
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong> Phase I: Making offers </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
        Everyone starts a round of negotiations with a proposal. A proposal consists of: 1) a choice about which coalition you want to form, 2) an offer of how you want to divide the 9000 euros within this coalition; i.e. how much you want yourself and how much you want the other member(s) of the coalition to get. Of course, you can only propose a coalition in which you yourself participate        </p>
        <p>
        <strong> Phase II: Choosing offers </strong>
        <p>
        </p>
        At this stage, you will see all three proposals. So you will see your own proposal as well as the proposals from the other two participants in this study. Then you choose the proposal you want to implement. Of course, you can choose only a proposal that you have made yourself or one where you are included in the coalition.        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Phase III: Coalition results </strong>
        <p>
        </p>
        The final stage of a round of negotiations shows whether a coalition has been established. Everyone gets to see what everyone has chosen.  If all members of a coalition proposal actually want to implement the proposal, the coalition is formed. The bonus of 9000 euros is then divided among the members of the coalition. Thus, in the case of a coalition of two companies, two people must agree. Thus, in the case of a coalition of three companies, three people must agree.
        </p>
        <p>
        It is possible that no coalition proposal is chosen by the participants involved. In that case, no coalition is formed and a new round of negotiations begins. All negotiators then go back to Phase I and make a new coalition proposal. This process continues until a two-person coalition or a three-person coalition is concluded.        </p>
